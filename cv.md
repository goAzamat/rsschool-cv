## About Myself 

My name is Azamat. I'm a junior frontend engineer, currently based in Moscow but originally from Bishkek. 

I work for one of Horeca's leading ingredient companies, as a senior barista-developer of beverages. 

I fell in love with coding and became interested in 2021 on a work trip to Qatar, Doha. Lived there for 2 years.

If I talk about my hobbies I love travelling and exploring new places and listening to music. 

I'm a Fresher. My Strength is I'm a quick learner, self-motivated and hard-working.

My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company where I can improve my skills and experience.
